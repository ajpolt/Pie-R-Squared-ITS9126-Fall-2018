# Pie-R-Squared-ITS9126-Fall-2018

Our in class coding project for Week 1 of ITS-9126 - Intro to Android Development, Fall 2018.

An 8" pizza is four times smaller than a 16" pizza. Our app lets a user see which of two pizzas is a better deal based on the diameters and prices without having to do the math themselves!
